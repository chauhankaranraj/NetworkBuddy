NetworkBuddy
===================================

NetworkBuddy is a simple program which can be used by the common man, and which performs various tasks depending on what devices are connected to the local network.
It was created as the project for MIT IOT Hackathon in July 2017


Functions
------------
NetworkBuddy scans the local network either periodically or just once, for two primary functions:
1. To determine if there are any suspicious/unknown devices (based on mac address), and alert the user by lighting up an LED and/or sounding a buzzer
2. To perform tasks assigned by each registered user, if that user is connected to the network
